# Advent Of (Low) Code 2022

[Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about). I decided to take on the challenge of completing these daily challenges using Power Fx in Power Apps. Note that this isn't necessarily trivial: programming puzzles are typically much easier to solve in an imperative way. Power Fx can handle imperative logic just fine, but as of this writing it does not have certain traditional imperative capabilities like straight-up loops and recursion. I expect that to be the biggest challenge in completing the Advent of Code.

## Spoiler Alert
I'm not providing the actual values to submit, but I am posting the Power Fx expressions I used to calculate them so you can try them out in Power Apps. I guess it's translatable to traditional programming language logic as well, but requires some work to do so. Advent of Code has no prizes, and the bragging rights for high scores really are only for people submitting almost as soon as the challenge is revealed. With several days delay in posting here that's off the table as well. I see no problem posting my logic here, but in theory yes there be spoilers here.

## Goals
My main goal is to broaden my personal knowledge and usage of the Power Fx language and understand its limitations and workarounds for traditional programming problems. On the flipside, I want to show that the language is very capable even with imperative problems, and also hopefully give some citizen developers ideas to using more advanced logic.

## Challenges
- [Day 1 - Calorie Counting](./Day1/)<br/>
    Synopsis: Parse out a large flat list of values, separated to indicate where in the list a new "group" starts. For each group do some calculations and determine the highest sum.
- [Day 2 - Rock Paper Scissors](./Day2/)<br/>
    Synopsis: Give a list of moves, calculate outcomes or calculate moves that would give the desired outcome.
